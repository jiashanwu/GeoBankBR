# The SoD Project

This project aims to analyze the SoD (summary of deposits) data in understanding the geographical distribution of banks in US. The details of the dataset can be found in [here](https://www7.fdic.gov/sod/dynaDownload.asp?barItem=6).

The project mainly uses Jupyter Notebook for data prepossessing as well as visualization.

As a pilot study, I first make an effort to understand the 2019 data, see [SoD2019](https://github.com/jiashanwu/GeoBankBR/tree/master/GeoBankBR2019).
